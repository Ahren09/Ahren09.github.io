## My Research Journey

Welcome to my academic website! I'm Yiqiao Jin, a CS PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Srijan Kumar. My research focuses on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Learning, and Social Computing.

## Current Research Areas

My work spans several interconnected domains:

### ü§ñ Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Safety and Robustness**: Developing methods to make LLMs more reliable and safe for real-world deployment
- **Cross-lingual Evaluation**: Understanding how LLMs perform across different languages and cultural contexts
- **Agent-based Systems**: Exploring how LLMs can work together in multi-agent environments

### üåê Multimodal Learning
- **Social Media Understanding**: Building models that can comprehend multimodal content on social platforms
- **Web UI and Video Tutorial Understanding**: Developing systems that can interpret and interact with visual interfaces
- **Protein Structure Analysis**: Applying multimodal approaches to biological data understanding

### üìä Social Computing
- **Information Pathways**: Predicting how information spreads across online communities
- **Fair Graph Mining**: Ensuring fairness in graph-based machine learning systems
- **Dynamic Graph Analysis**: Understanding temporal patterns in social networks

## Recent Highlights

- **EMNLP 2025**: Published work on peer review dynamics using LLM agents
- **ACL 2025**: Benchmarking multimodal LLMs in social media platforms
- **TheWebConf 2025**: Cross-lingual evaluation of LLMs for healthcare queries
- **KDD 2023**: Predicting information pathways across online communities

## Beyond Research

When I'm not diving deep into research, I enjoy:
- ü•æ **Hiking**: Exploring nature trails and mountain paths
- üì∑ **Photography**: Capturing moments and landscapes
- üê∞ **Rabbit Care**: Taking care of my beloved pet rabbit

## Let's Connect!
