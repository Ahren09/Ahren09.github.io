## About Me

Helloüëã! I am Yiqiao Jin (Èù≥ËΩ∂‰πî, Ahren), a CS Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Srijan Kumar](https://cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/). 

I develop efficient multimodal AI systems, such as multi-agent systems (MASs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). 


My research has led to <b>20+ top-tier publications</b>, along with recognition including the <b>Microsoft Research "Star of Tomorrow" Award</b>, <b>Roblox Graduate Fellowship Finalist</b>, and <b>UCLA Dean‚Äôs Honor List</b> (5 times). My works are featured in leading media outlets such as <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chatbots-medical-questions-language/">Scientific American</a> and <a href="https://theworld.org/segments/2024/04/04/chatbots-making-mistakes-when-translating-medical-advice-in-some-languages"> The World</a>.

During my doctoral studies üéì, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at J.P. Morgan AI Research, Adobe Research, and Visa Research.

Previously, as an undergraduate at UCLA üßë‚Äçüíª, I worked as a research scientist intern at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/groups/), Social Computing Group, directed by [Dr. Xing Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5EQfAFIAAAAJ). I was mentored by [Dr. Xiting Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=urC8meQAAAAJ) and [Dr. Jindong Wang](https://jd92.wang/), and lead research projects on Large Language Models, Explainable NLP, and Large Language Models. I also worked as a research assistant at Scalable Analytics Institute ([ScAi](https://scai.cs.ucla.edu/)) on graph neural networks and recommender systems under the mentorship of [Prof. Yizhou Sun](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/) and [Prof. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/)
